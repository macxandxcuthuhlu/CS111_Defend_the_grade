And thus was the fond memory of how you 
accidentally failed your second year during Covid.

Although, you were sad at the time.
It allowed you to retake the courses
when you actually where in a mental state to learn.

Now you are 5th year who is applying to many CS jobs, 
and the prospects look hopeful.

Then, you look back to your freind James
who apparently also had a rough year during Covid

Would you like to listen to his tale?

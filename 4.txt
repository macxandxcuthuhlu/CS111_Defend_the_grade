The next day a scary email floats up in
your inbox.

It is from the University infomring you that
your grades sadly dropped below that required to pass.

You are crestfallen reading the news and decide to switch
to an economics major which you learn that you love.

You eventually become an actuary making $150,000 a year,
and you are completely content with your life.

Your son seems like he is taking a similar journey
to how yours started.
Do you want to follow him on his path?

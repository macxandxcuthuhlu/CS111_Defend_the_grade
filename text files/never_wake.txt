You missed all of your classes for the day,
but at very least 
you had a really high mental health score, 
and mabey it was necessary 
since you stayed up late
finishing your homework for today.


This does not define you, 
and you can continue to try again.


Instead, if you want,
 you can decide college is not right for you, 
 and that is okay.


 So is it right path for your life?
 (or at least worth another shot)

Hi! 

This is the game I made for my CS 111 project by the name of Defend the Grade. 
It is inspired by a flash game by the name of Storm the House but instead about time management.

In its current state it probably will not run as I could not figure out how to use git ignore, 
but this can be easily fixed by taking all of the files outside of their folders 
that are mainly there just to make things look nice.
